##  Business Rules

1. A **User** can have only one **role**: either `"teacher"` or `"learner"` (`role` is an enumeration).
2. Only **Teachers** can **upload Assignments** and **Memos**.
3. Only **Learners** can **submit Submissions** and **receive Recommendations**.
4. One **Assignment** must have **only one Memo**, but may have many Submissions.
5. A **Learner** can appear **only once on the Leaderboard**.
6. **Messages** must occur **between Users**, but learners and teachers cannot message each other outside the platform (POPIA compliance).
7. The **Leaderboard** is ranked based on total_score across Submissions.
8. **Recommendations** are generated based on performance trends in Submissions.

## ðŸ§  Notes

- Methods are indicative; full implementation logic would depend on controller/service layers.
- This domain model enforces separation of concerns between users, learning materials, and communication.
- AI functionality can be abstracted as part of `Recommendation.generate()` or as an external service linked to Learner interactions.
